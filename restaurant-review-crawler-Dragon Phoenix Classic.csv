Dragon Phoenix Classic,Good food,It’s been a while since I visited this restaurant. The food is still very good. The beef steak and yam ring are good. So is the Kyoto pork, 16 November 2017,5,Singapore,$,
Dragon Phoenix Classic,OLD NEW PLACE,Have eaten at the original location of DP at outram park decades ago and also at where they are in town now at Liang Court (Clark Quay area). Decided to try their out of the city location at Rifle Range Range road (Temasek club). We straight for the familiar favourites - chinese style beef steaks  kyoto pork chops  a starter platter of 3 item (wasabi prawns  chicken in wine and spring rolls)  HK Kailan in garlic and peking duck and noodles (fried with the duck meat).The best of all was the peking duck. Food at DP is comfort and safe bet. We had to pack the noodles as there was 5 of us but the portion was probably for at least 8. The service was good and we like the place and environment. Away from the city  plenty of greenery  spacious and clean. full length glass windows allowing plenty of light in and also a nice and relaxing view of the surroundings. Parking is conveniently located at the basement and the lifts took us straight to the restaurant level., 11 August 2017,4,Singapore  Singapore,$,

Dragon Phoenix Classic,Good ol' comfort food,Dragon Phoenix is one of Singapore’s oldest Chinese restaurants. Apparently the founding master chef is considered one of Singapore’s “four heavenly chefs”  responsible for our “lo hei yusheng”  a festive raw fish salad dish eaten during the Lunar New Year . He also created perennial classics like chilly crab and yam ring.
It was a lazy May Day evening and we merely wanted to try the Chinese restaurant at “new” Temasek Club on Rifle Range Road by the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.
The Dragon Phoenix Grand is  like its food  simple and tastefully decorated; nothing over the top. I was attracted by the grey parquet floors combined uniquely with similarly-toned Peranakan tiles.
The items on the menu may seem very old school but I found them very “comfort food”. The deep-fried yam ring with stirred fried cube-sized vegetables and cashews was classically done: the taro ring is light not chunky nor oily. We nibbled on it like a snack with a rather fruity Sileni Sauvignon Blanc Marlborough and in fact finished the rather large portion.
The house special beef was a steal at $9 a portion and we ordered two. It was very well marinated and tenderized for a steak but it was perfect as a Chinese dish with rice.
The prawn paste chicken wings (har cheong gai) was another classic and again  very delicately seasoned and fried. We had a simple kai lan vegetables stirred fried with garlic to complete the meal.
Other tables were having these classics and others such as Kyoto pork ribs and Phoenix spring chicken. Whilst some may feel that this is no more than an air-conditioned zichar restaurant  cooking and serving simple food well is a dedicated art. I’m glad Dragon Phoenix kept to their core and perfected it.
The restaurant is relatively large but the service was very attentive and pleasant. There didn’t seem to be rank and file managers  waiters and busboys. The same waiters/waitresses took turns to take our order  serve our food  clear our dishes and refilled our drinks. There was a healthy turnover of tables but the food was served before you know it.
It was too dark for us to appreciate the surrounding nature but I reckon it is a rather unusual setting for urban Singapore. Great place to take the family for a simple yet delicious meal for a lazy weekend., 3 May 2017,4,Singapore  Singapore,$,
