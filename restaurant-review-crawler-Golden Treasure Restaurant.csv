Golden Treasure Restaurant,Excellent food and service,This place is in the CBD very close to many of the large East Perth hotels. A fairly basic set up with clean and modern seating. A well priced menu and very hearty portions with great tasting sauces. Stir fry meats/ vegetables all well cooked to our taste. We had chicken and sweet corn soup  delicious honey and pepper ribs to start  chicken fried rice  chicken and black bean sauce and BBQ pork with vegetable noodles  followed by (shared) banana fritter and Ice-cream and coffee for under $80. Owner  chef is very friendly and happy to talk about the sauces., 12 February 2018,4,Singapore,$,

The food tasted great and the portions were rather big. We ordered combination fried rice  mixed vegetables  claypot chicken and mushroom and spring rolls  more than enough for the four of us.

Golden Treasure Restaurant,Great tasting  local Chinese food,Dined at Golden Treasure a week ago. In short: Great tasting  local Chinese food. They provide good portion sizes at a great price point  especially considering the location (inner city). I'm very much a meat eater but was also surprised at how delicious the vegetable dishes we ordered were. Will continue to be a repeat customer., 24 December 2017,5,Singapore,$,
