Good Year Seafood Village,Nice kampung style restaurant,This Zhi char restaurant is located at Farmart is difficult to access for those without their own vehicles. Although there's a free feeder bus service from Chua Chu Kang Lot 1  it may not be convenient. Taking taxi there may not be a problem but to get a taxi after your meal may be a problem.

Transportation aside  this restaurant is set in a rustic surrounding. Even on a hot day  the ample fans at the restaurant were able to cool the place to a comfortable level during your dining.

Went there to celebrate 2 of my friends' birthday. Ordered the seafood platter which comes with crab  prawns  sotong  gor hiang  crayfish  clams and pork chop. (Please refer to photo.) The food is delicious  service is up to expectation although the serving staff may not come across as friendly but they are responsive to your needs if you alert them to serve you.

The lunch crowd on a Saturday was packed but within 2 hrs the crowd was gone.

I will be back as I like the place and the food. This is my 3rd time there but first time I tried the sea food platter which my friends and I like very much.

Advice : to call and book your reservation if you are dining on weekend. Go only if you have your own vehicle. Or someone to send you there., 29 April 2017,4,Singapore  Singapore,$,

Good Year Seafood Village,Zi Char food at reasonable price,This food outlet is located at Farmart  which is inaccessible if you do not drive. The food taste better than average and prices are reasonable too. I would recommend their signature 'gu yue' pork chop  a pan fried chop chop which is well marinated and tender., 12 July 2016,4,Singapore  Singapore,$,
Good Year Seafood Village,Excellent food at reasonable prices with good service,We go to Farmart all the way specially to eat here. Very good zhi char fare  which is value for money.

This time we had cereal prawns  sambal lala  pork ribs king & seafood fried rice., 19 June 2016,5,Singapore  Singapore,$,
Good Year Seafood Village,Price above business districts ... quality as per suburbs ....,Food quality and taste is as per suburbs ... dun see any values or virtues to commands premium pricing that's 50%

There's little or no other alternatives for food within 2km ... perhaps that's the only justification ...

Go if it's your only food option available ... else will strongly suggest other venues., 24 May 2013,2,Singapore,$,
