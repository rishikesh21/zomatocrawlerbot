Soon Kee Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle,Yummy!,2nd time here  for the fried hokkien prawn mee. This time tried the normal version without the roasted meat  a large portion goes for $8. Still very delicious  and the chilli does pack a punch! Love this place., 26 July 2017,5,Singapore  Singapore,$,
Soon Kee Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle,Yummylicous!,Just enjoyed one of my best Fried Hokkien Mee.
Almost when to the wrong shop behind which look more presentable but so happy to discover this Gem.
The ingredients like the cuttlefish  fried lard  roast pork were fresh and tasty.
The icing was their sambal which enhance the taste to another level.
Ordering a plate with the roast pork topping is highly recommended.
Also had the Yong Tau Foo soup from same row to enjoy a really nice lunch., 5 July 2017,5,S'pore,$,
Soon Kee Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle,Awesome Hokkien Mee!,Ranked as one of the great Hokkien Mee in Singapore  their version is wet with a generous portion of sotong and prawn  with a very spicy chilli that just increases the flavour! There's also an option to add roast meat in the mix  which goes very well with the noodles and chilli. Having tried a good number of the good HKM in Singapore  I personally feel that this is one of the top 3. Opens early from 830am  so do head down earlier to avoid the lunch and dinner time crowds., 26 May 2017,5,Singapore  Singapore,$,
